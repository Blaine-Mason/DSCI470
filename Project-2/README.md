# Robust and Efficient Learning of Simplices

### How to run the Data Tool
---
- Create a folder named to your liking (Here I use "Blaine-Mason-Project)
- Move the following files into the directory:       
    - final.py
    - fblib.py
    - requirements.txt
- Your file tree should appear as:
```
Blaine-Mason-Project
│   final.py
│   fblib.py    
│   requirements.txt
```
- Now, to install the required libraries run:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
- Run the python file 'final.py':
```
python final.py
```

#### The on screen instructions should be fairly self explanitory, but I understand since you are grading you may not want to spend a long amount of time generating data.  Below I have included and example run:

WITHOUT FLOATING BODY (Hit enter following each input):
- 2
- 1000
- 5000
- 500
- 1 
- TEST

WITH FLOATING BODY (Hit enter following each input):
- 1
- 1000
- 5000
- 500
- 1 
- TEST2

PLOT W/O FB (Hit enter following each input):
- 3
- TEST
- plot
- 1000
- 5000
- 500
- Simplex Error w/o FB

PLOT W FB (Hit enter following each input):
